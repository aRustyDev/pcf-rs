## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Empty Modules

- Only included sections with actual content

### 2. Implemented Nested Tree Structure

- Created 44 new README.md files
- Renamed all index.md files to README.md
- Updated all internal links automatically
- Created 50 .old.md files for content needing review

## New Structure

```
src/
├── admin/           # Administrator documentation
├── developer/       # Developer documentation  
├── user/           # User documentation
├── reference/      # Reference materials
└── README.md       # Main overview
```

## Next Steps
