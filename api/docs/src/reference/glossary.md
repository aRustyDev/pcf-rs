# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the PCF API documentation.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.

**Async/Await**
: Rust's approach to asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking I/O operations.

**Authentication**
: The process of verifying the identity of a user or service.

**Authorization**
: The process of determining what permissions an authenticated user has.

## C

**Circuit Breaker**
: A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
: A mechanism that allows restricted resources to be requested from another domain.

**Cursor-based Pagination**
: A pagination method using opaque cursors instead of offset/limit, more efficient for large datasets.

## D

**DataLoader**
: A pattern for batching and caching database queries to solve the N+1 query problem.

**Dependency Injection**
: A design pattern where dependencies are provided to an object rather than created by it.

**Docker**
: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## E

**Environment Variable**
: A dynamic value that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer.

**Error Context**
: Additional information attached to errors to help with debugging.

## F

**Figment**
: A configuration library for Rust that supports multiple sources and formats.

## G

**Garde**
: A Rust validation library used for validating configuration and input data.

**GraphQL**
: A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.

**Graceful Shutdown**
: The process of cleanly shutting down a service, allowing in-flight requests to complete.

## H

**Health Check**
: An endpoint that reports the operational status of a service.

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
: The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

## I

**Idempotent**
: An operation that produces the same result when applied multiple times.

**Introspection**
: GraphQL's ability to query its own schema for available types and fields.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
: A lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties.

## K

**Kubernetes (K8s)**
: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## L

**Liveness Probe**
: A health check that determines if a container should be restarted.

**Logging**
: The process of recording events that occur during software execution.

## M

**Middleware**
: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications.

**Mutation**
: A GraphQL operation that modifies data on the server.

## N

**N+1 Query Problem**
: A performance issue where one query spawns N additional queries.

## O

**Observability**
: The ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs.

**OpenTelemetry**
: A collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for instrumenting, generating, and collecting telemetry data.

## P

**Pagination**
: The process of dividing content into discrete pages.

**Prometheus**
: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.

## Q

**Query**
: A GraphQL operation that reads data without side effects.

**Query Complexity**
: A measure of how expensive a GraphQL query is to execute.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
: Controlling the rate of requests a user can make to an API.

**Readiness Probe**
: A health check that determines if a container is ready to accept traffic.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
: An architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.

## S

**Schema**
: A formal description of the data structure, especially in GraphQL.

**Structured Logging**
: Logging with consistent, machine-parsable format.

**Subscription**
: A GraphQL operation that maintains a persistent connection for real-time updates.

**SurrealDB**
: A multi-model database used in the demo implementation.

## T

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)**
: Cryptographic protocol for secure communication.

**TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)**
: A configuration file format that's easy to read.

**Tower**
: A library of modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers.

**Tracing**
: Following the path of a request through a distributed system.

**Trait**
: Rust's approach to defining shared behavior, similar to interfaces in other languages.

## U

**UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)**
: A 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems.

## V

**Validation**
: The process of checking if data conforms to defined rules and constraints.

## W

**WebSocket**
: A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
