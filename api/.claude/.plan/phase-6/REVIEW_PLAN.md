# Phase 6 Review Plan - Guidelines for Reviewing Agents

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 6 checkpoints. As a reviewing agent, you are responsible for ensuring the performance optimizations meet all specifications, achieve target metrics, and maintain code quality.

## Your Responsibilities as Reviewer

1. **Thoroughly examine all provided artifacts**
2. **Run performance benchmarks and verify results**
3. **Test N+1 query prevention with specific scenarios**
4. **Verify cache hit rates and isolation**
5. **Test timeout cascade behavior**
6. **Run load tests at target RPS**
7. **Profile for performance bottlenecks**
8. **Verify TDD practices were followed**
9. **Provide explicit feedback on findings**
10. **Give clear approval or rejection**

## Core Review Principles

### Performance Target Verification
At every checkpoint, verify performance targets are met:
1. **P99 latency < 200ms** - Under normal load
2. **1000 RPS sustained** - With 99% success rate
3. **No N+1 queries** - In any code path
4. **Cache hit rate > 50%** - For common queries
5. **Linear CPU scaling** - Performance scales with cores

### DataLoader Verification
Ensure N+1 prevention is comprehensive:
1. **All relationships use DataLoader** - No direct queries in resolvers
2. **Batch sizes optimized** - Not too large (memory) or small (efficiency)
3. **Request scoping works** - Cache cleared between requests
4. **Metrics show batching** - Batch efficiency tracked
5. **No over-fetching** - Only requested data loaded

### Cache Security Verification
Check cache isolation and security:
1. **User data isolated** - No cross-user data leakage
2. **Cache keys secure** - Include user context
3. **TTLs appropriate** - Not too long for stale data
4. **Invalidation works** - Mutations clear affected entries
5. **Memory bounded** - Cache size limits enforced

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
Continue verifying TDD practices:
1. **Tests exist before implementation** - Check git history
2. **Performance tests comprehensive** - Load, stress, spike tests
3. **Benchmarks established** - Baseline measurements
4. **Edge cases covered** - Timeout scenarios, cache misses

## Review Process

For each checkpoint review:

1. **Receive from implementing agent**:
   - Link to Phase 6 REVIEW_PLAN.md
   - Link to Phase 6 WORK_PLAN.md
   - Specific checkpoint number
   - All artifacts listed for that checkpoint
   - Performance test results

2. **Perform the review** using checkpoint-specific checklist

3. **Run performance verification**:
   - Execute benchmarks
   - Run load tests
   - Check query patterns
   - Measure cache effectiveness

4. **Document your findings** in structured format

5. **Provide clear decision**: APPROVED or CHANGES REQUIRED

## Checkpoint-Specific Review Guidelines

### ðŸ›‘ CHECKPOINT 1: DataLoader Implementation Review

**What You're Reviewing**: N+1 query prevention with DataLoader

**Key Specifications to Verify**:
- DataLoader trait implemented correctly
- Batch loading works for all entities
- Request-scoped caching functional
- GraphQL context integration complete
- No N+1 queries in tests

**Required Tests**:
```bash
# Run N+1 detection tests
cargo test --test n_plus_one_detection

# Check specific resolver patterns
cargo test test_user_notes_relationship_batching
cargo test test_note_author_relationship_batching

# Verify batch metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep dataloader_batch

# Test with complex nested query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "{ 
      users(first: 100) { 
        id 
        name 
        notes { 
          id 
          title 
          tags { 
            name 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    }"
  }'

# Monitor database queries (should see batching)
# Enable query logging and count unique queries
```

**Batch Efficiency Verification**:
```bash
# Generate load with relationships
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
    -d '{"query":"{ users { notes { author { name } } } }"}'
done

# Check metrics for batch efficiency
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep -E "dataloader_batch_size|dataloader_load_count"
# Batch efficiency = load_count / batch_count (should be > 5)
```

## How to Handle Issues

When you find issues during review:

1. **Categorize by severity**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Fails load test, N+1 queries present
   - **HIGH**: Misses performance targets, cache leaks
   - **MEDIUM**: Suboptimal but functional
   - **LOW**: Documentation, minor improvements

2. **Test performance thoroughly**:
   - Does it meet 1000 RPS? (CRITICAL)
   - Is P99 < 200ms? (CRITICAL)
   - Are N+1 queries eliminated? (HIGH)
   - Is cache effective? (HIGH)

3. **Provide specific fixes**:
   ```markdown
   Issue: N+1 queries in user->notes relationship
   Severity: HIGH
   Fix: Add DataLoader to notes resolver:
   ```rust
   async fn notes(&self, ctx: &Context<'_>) -> Result<Vec<Note>> {
       let loader = ctx.data::<DataLoader<NoteLoader>>()?;
       loader.load_many_by_user(self.id).await
   }
   ```

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
Grant approval when:
- All Done Criteria met
- Load test passes at 1000 RPS

   ```

2. **Concurrent Load**
   ```bash
   # Target load

   ```

4. **N+1 Detection**
