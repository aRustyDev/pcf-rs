# Phase 4 Review Plan - Guidelines for Reviewing Agents

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 4 checkpoints. As a reviewing agent, you are responsible for ensuring the authorization implementation meets all specifications, provides proper resilience, and integrates seamlessly with previous phases.

## Your Responsibilities as Reviewer

1. **Thoroughly examine all provided artifacts**
2. **Test authorization flows end-to-end**
3. **Verify resilience patterns (circuit breaker, fallback)**
4. **Check cache implementation and performance**
5. **Validate audit logging completeness**
6. **Test degraded mode operation**
7. **Ensure security best practices**
8. **Verify TDD practices were followed**
9. **Provide explicit feedback on findings**
10. **Give clear approval or rejection**

## Core Review Principles

### Authorization Security Verification
At every checkpoint, verify security requirements are met:
1. **Fail-secure approach** - Default deny, explicit allow
2. **Proper error codes** - 401 vs 403 distinction
3. **No information leakage** - Generic error messages
4. **Audit completeness** - Every decision logged
5. **Positive-only caching** - Never cache denials

### Resilience Verification
Ensure the system remains available during failures:
1. **Circuit breaker works** - Opens/closes appropriately
2. **Fallback rules apply** - Conservative permissions
3. **Cache extends during outage** - 30-minute TTL
4. **Health checks bypass auth** - Always accessible
5. **Graceful degradation** - Read-only during outage

### Performance Verification
Check authorization doesn't become a bottleneck:
1. **Cache hit rate > 80%** - After warm-up period
2. **Sub-10ms cached checks** - Fast path optimization
3. **Batch authorization** - For list operations
4. **LRU eviction works** - Cache doesn't grow unbounded
5. **Metrics available** - For monitoring

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
Continue verifying TDD practices:
1. **Tests exist before implementation** - Check git history
2. **Tests fail first, then pass** - Red-Green-Refactor
3. **Tests cover failure scenarios** - Outages, denials
4. **Integration tests comprehensive** - End-to-end flows

## Review Process

For each checkpoint review:

1. **Receive from implementing agent**:
   - Link to Phase 4 REVIEW_PLAN.md
   - Link to Phase 4 WORK_PLAN.md
   - Specific checkpoint number
   - All artifacts listed for that checkpoint
   - Evidence of TDD approach

2. **Perform the review** using checkpoint-specific checklist

3. **Test critical authorization features**:
   - Permission checks work correctly
   - Circuit breaker activates on failures
   - Cache improves performance
   - Fallback rules are conservative
   - Audit logs capture all decisions

4. **Document your findings** in structured format

5. **Provide clear decision**: APPROVED or CHANGES REQUIRED

## Checkpoint-Specific Review Guidelines

### ðŸ›‘ CHECKPOINT 1: Authorization Framework Review

**What You're Reviewing**: Core authorization helper and context

**Key Specifications to Verify**:
- Standard is_authorized function exists
- Auth context properly extracted
- Demo mode bypass works
- Fallback rules implemented
- Session extraction from JWT

**Required Tests**:
```bash
# Test authorization helper
cargo test helpers::authorization

# Test without authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ note(id: \"123\") { title } }"}'
# Should return UNAUTHORIZED

# Test with authentication but no permission
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test_token" \
  -d '{"query":"{ note(id: \"restricted\") { title } }"}'
# Should return FORBIDDEN

# Test demo mode
DEMO_MODE=true cargo run --features demo
# Should bypass all auth checks
```

**Fallback Rules Test**:
```bash
# Simulate SpiceDB unavailable
# Only these should work:
# - Health checks (always)
# - User reading own profile
# - All writes should be denied
```

**Your Review Output Should Include**:

## How to Handle Issues

When you find issues during review:

1. **Categorize by severity**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, auth bypasses
   - **HIGH**: Resilience failures, no audit logs
   - **MEDIUM**: Performance issues, missing metrics
   - **LOW**: Documentation, code style

2. **Test security thoroughly**:
   - Can auth be bypassed? (CRITICAL)
   - Do fallback rules expose data? (CRITICAL)
   - Are denials cached? (HIGH)
   - Is audit logging complete? (HIGH)

3. **Provide specific fixes**:
   ```markdown
   Issue: Negative results being cached
   Severity: HIGH
   Fix: Add check in cache.set():
   ```rust
   if !allowed {
       return; // Never cache negative results
   }
   ```

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
Grant approval when:
- All Done Criteria met
- Security implementation solid
- Resilience patterns work
- Performance acceptable
- Only LOW severity issues

### CHANGES REQUIRED
Require changes when:
- Security vulnerabilities found
- Auth can be bypassed
- No resilience to failures
- Audit logging incomplete
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH issues

## Testing Authorization Resilience

Critical scenarios that MUST be tested:

1. **SpiceDB Unavailable at Startup**
   - Server should start successfully
   - Health checks should work
   - Fallback rules should apply
   - Clear logging of degraded state

2. **SpiceDB Fails During Operation**
   - Existing cache continues working
   - New requests use fallback
   - Circuit breaker activates
   - Automatic recovery when available

3. **Cache Overflow**
   - LRU eviction activates
   - Performance remains stable
   - No memory leaks
   - Metrics show evictions

4. **High Permission Churn**
   - Many unique permission checks
   - Cache remains effective
   - No thundering herd on SpiceDB

## Final Review Checklist

- [ ] Verified resilience patterns
- [ ] Checked cache effectiveness
- [ ] Validated audit completeness
