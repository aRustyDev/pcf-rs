# Phase 4 Review Plan - Authorization & Authentication

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 4 checkpoints. Phase 4 implements secure authorization with SpiceDB integration, caching, and resilience patterns. The system must never fail due to authorization service unavailability while maintaining security.

## Review Context

Phase 4 adds the authorization layer to the PCF-RS API, requiring careful review of:
- Authorization helper pattern consistency
- Caching implementation (positive-only, 5-minute TTL)
- Circuit breaker resilience patterns
- SpiceDB integration and fallback rules
- Security implications of all decisions
- Performance impact on GraphQL operations

## Core Review Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
At every checkpoint, MUST verify TDD practices by checking:
1. **Authorization tests exist before implementation**
2. **Cache tests precede cache code**
3. **Circuit breaker tests written before state machine**
4. **Fallback tests before fallback rules**
5. **All edge cases covered** - no auth, wrong auth, SpiceDB down, cache full

### Documentation Standards
Authorization code MUST have comprehensive documentation including:
1. **Security implications documented** - Why decisions are conservative
2. **Cache strategy explained** - Why positive-only, TTL choices
3. **Fallback rules justified** - Why specific operations allowed/denied
4. **Circuit breaker thresholds** - Why specific values chosen
5. **Audit requirements clear** - What must be logged and why

### Code Quality Requirements
1. **NO .unwrap() or .expect() in production code paths** - test code and compile-time constants MAY use these with justification
2. **All async operations properly handled** - No forgotten awaits
3. **Resource cleanup guaranteed** - Cache cleanup tasks, connections
4. **No sensitive data in logs** - User IDs okay, tokens/passwords never
5. **Thread safety verified** - All shared state properly protected

## Review Process Flow

1. **Receive checkpoint artifacts**:
   - Checkpoint number and description
   - All code files created/modified
   - Test output showing TDD approach
   - Any questions in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-questions.md`

2. **Execute comprehensive review checklist**

3. **Test the authorization implementation** using provided test commands

4. **Check for cleanliness and artifacts**

5. **Document findings** in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-feedback.md`

6. **Write progress notes** in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-review-vY.md`

7. **Answer any questions** found in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-questions.md`

8. **Provide clear decision**:
   - APPROVED: All requirements met, no issues found
   - APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS: Minor issues that can be fixed in parallel
   - CHANGES REQUIRED: Critical issues blocking progress

## Review Scope Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Reviews are scoped to ONLY:
- The current checkpoint being reviewed
- Previously completed checkpoints in this phase
- Integration with Phase 1, 2, and 3 components

**DO NOT** review or suggest changes for future checkpoints.

## Checkpoint-Specific Review Guidelines

### ðŸ›‘ CHECKPOINT 1: Authorization Framework Review

**What You're Reviewing**: Core authorization helper, context extraction, session management, and audit logging

**Key Specifications to Verify**:
- Standard `is_authorized` helper follows specification pattern
- Authentication context properly extracted from headers
- Demo mode bypass only works with feature flag
- Audit logging captures all required fields
- Error responses distinguish 401 vs 403 correctly

**Required Tests** (MUST execute all and verify output):
```bash
# Test authorization helper
cargo test helpers::authorization::tests

# Test authentication context
cargo test auth::tests::test_auth_context

# Test demo mode bypass
cargo test --features demo test_demo_mode_bypass

# Verify audit logging
cargo test auth::audit::tests

# Check error responses
cargo test test_error_codes
```

**Critical Security Reviews**:
- Verify NO authorization bypasses except demo mode
- Check authentication is required for all operations
- Ensure audit logs cannot be disabled
- Validate error messages don't leak information
- Confirm session extraction is secure

**Performance Validation**:
- Context extraction should be < 1ms
- Helper function overhead minimal
- No blocking operations in auth path

## How to Test Authorization Scenarios

### Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test missing authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ notes { edges { node { id } } } }"}' \
  | jq '.errors[0].extensions.code' # Should be "UNAUTHORIZED"

# Test with authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: alice" \
  -d '{"query":"{ notes { edges { node { id } } } }"}' \
  | jq '.data' # Should return results
```

### Authorization Testing
```bash
# Setup test permissions in SpiceDB
zed relationship create notes:123 owner user:alice
zed relationship create notes:456 owner user:bob

# Test authorized access
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "x-user-id: alice" \
  -d '{"query":"{ note(id: \"123\") { title } }"}' # Should work

# Test unauthorized access
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "x-user-id: alice" \
  -d '{"query":"{ note(id: \"456\") { title } }"}' # Should be FORBIDDEN
```

### Circuit Breaker Testing
```bash
# Stop SpiceDB to trigger circuit breaker
docker stop spicedb

# Make several requests to open circuit
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
    -H "x-user-id: alice" \
    -d '{"query":"{ note(id: \"alice:123\") { title } }"}'
done

# Check metrics for circuit state
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep circuit_breaker_state
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Authorization Issues
1. **Missing auth checks**: Every GraphQL operation must call is_authorized
2. **Wrong resource format**: Must be "type:id" format
3. **Cache key format**: Must be "user:resource:action"
4. **Negative caching**: Never cache authorization denials
5. **Demo mode leaks**: No demo code in production builds

### Performance Issues
1. **Cache misses**: Should be <10% after warm-up
2. **SpiceDB latency**: Check connection pooling
3. **Circuit breaker too sensitive**: Adjust thresholds
4. **Memory growth**: Check cache eviction
5. **Slow fallback**: Fallback should be instant

### Security Issues
1. **Information leakage**: Error messages revealing system details
2. **Timing attacks**: Consistent response times
3. **Privilege escalation**: Fallback rules too permissive
4. **Missing audit logs**: Every decision must be logged
5. **Token exposure**: Never log authentication tokens

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
Grant approval ONLY when ALL of the following are met:
- All checklist items pass
- No CRITICAL or HIGH issues
- Tests achieve >95% coverage on auth paths
- Security review finds no vulnerabilities
- Performance meets requirements
- No cleanliness issues found

### APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
MAY grant conditional approval when:
- All CRITICAL issues resolved
- Plan exists for HIGH issues
- MEDIUM issues documented
- Timeline for fixes agreed
- No security risks

### CHANGES REQUIRED
MUST require changes when:
- Any CRITICAL issues found
- Security vulnerabilities exist
- Authorization can be bypassed
- Tests failing or insufficient
- Major cleanliness issues
- Performance unacceptable

## Final Phase 4 Validation

Before approving Phase 4 completion:
1. Manually test authorization on all endpoints
2. Verify audit logs capture all decisions
3. Simulate SpiceDB outage and test fallback
4. Check cache metrics and hit rates
5. Ensure no authorization bypasses exist
6. Validate demo mode is development-only
7. Confirm production deployment ready

## Recovery Guidance for Reviewers

### When Tests Fail
1. Check if SpiceDB is running (`docker ps`)
2. Verify test database has fixtures
3. Check for port conflicts
4. Review test logs for details

### When Integration Fails
1. Verify all components running
2. Check configuration alignment
3. Review integration test setup
4. Trace through auth flow

### When Performance is Poor
1. Check cache configuration
2. Verify SpiceDB connection pooling
3. Look for synchronous operations
4. Profile authorization path

Remember: Phase 4 establishes the security foundation for the entire API. Be thorough in review, as authorization bugs can have severe consequences.
