# Phase 3 Review Plan - Guidelines for Reviewing Agents

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 3 checkpoints. As a reviewing agent, you are responsible for ensuring the GraphQL implementation meets all specifications, integrates properly with Phase 1 & 2 infrastructure, and follows security best practices.

## Your Responsibilities as Reviewer

1. **Thoroughly examine all provided artifacts**
2. **Test GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions)**
3. **Verify security controls are enforced**
4. **Check performance optimizations work**
5. **Validate error handling and messages**
6. **Test WebSocket subscriptions**
7. **Ensure metrics collection functions**
8. **Verify TDD practices were followed**
9. **Provide explicit feedback on findings**
10. **Give clear approval or rejection**

## Core Review Principles

### GraphQL Security Verification
At every checkpoint, verify security requirements are met:
1. **Query depth limiting** - Default 15, configurable
2. **Query complexity calculation** - Default 1000 points
3. **Introspection disabled** - Only in production
4. **Playground restricted** - Demo mode only
5. **Input validation** - All inputs validated with Garde

### Performance Verification
Ensure performance optimizations are implemented:
1. **DataLoader pattern** - N+1 queries prevented
2. **Query timeouts** - 30 second maximum
3. **Subscription limits** - 1000 per instance
4. **Caching where appropriate** - Schema introspection cached
5. **Efficient pagination** - Cursor-based with limits

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
Continue verifying TDD practices from previous phases:
1. **Tests exist before implementation** - Check git history
2. **Tests fail first, then pass** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
3. **Tests drive the design** - Implementation matches test requirements
4. **Tests are comprehensive** - All operations, security, errors

### Integration Standards
Phase 3 must integrate seamlessly with Phase 1 & 2:
1. **Uses Phase 1 error types** - Mapped to GraphQL errors
2. **Uses Phase 2 database layer** - Through context
3. **Respects health check system** - GraphQL status included
4. **Emits proper metrics** - Prometheus format
5. **Follows logging standards** - Structured with trace IDs

## Review Process

For each checkpoint review:

1. **Receive from implementing agent**:
   - Link to Phase 3 REVIEW_PLAN.md
   - Link to Phase 3 WORK_PLAN.md
   - Specific checkpoint number
   - All artifacts listed for that checkpoint
   - Evidence of TDD approach

2. **Perform the review** using checkpoint-specific checklist

3. **Test critical GraphQL features**:
   - Query execution
   - Mutation operations
   - Subscription delivery
   - Security limits
   - Error handling

4. **Document your findings** in structured format

5. **Provide clear decision**: APPROVED or CHANGES REQUIRED

## Checkpoint-Specific Review Guidelines

## How to Handle Issues

When you find issues during review:

1. **Categorize by severity**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data exposure
   - **HIGH**: Missing functionality, performance issues
   - **MEDIUM**: Incomplete features, missing tests
   - **LOW**: Documentation, code style

2. **Test security thoroughly**:
   - Can queries exceed depth limit? (CRITICAL)
   - Can complexity be bypassed? (CRITICAL)
   - Is introspection available in production? (HIGH)
   - Are errors exposing internals? (HIGH)

3. **Provide specific fixes**:
   ```markdown
   Issue: Query depth limit not enforced
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Fix: Add depth validation to schema builder:
   ```rust
   let schema = Schema::build(Query, Mutation, Subscription)
       .limit_depth(15)
       .finish();
   ```

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
Grant approval when:
- All Done Criteria met
- Security controls enforced
- Performance acceptable
- Integration complete
- Only LOW severity issues

### CHANGES REQUIRED
Require changes when:
- Security controls missing or bypassable
- Core functionality not working
- Performance issues (N+1, slow queries)
- Integration broken
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH issues

## Testing GraphQL Security

Critical security scenarios that MUST be tested:

1. **Query Depth Attack**
   ```graphql
   # Create deeply nested query
   # Should be rejected at configured depth
   ```

2. **Query Complexity Attack**
   ```graphql
   # Request large result sets
   # Should be rejected over complexity limit
   ```

3. **Alias Bombing**
   ```graphql
   # Many aliases for same field
   # Should be limited
   ```

4. **Introspection in Production**
   ```graphql
   # __schema query
   # Should fail in production
   ```

Remember: GraphQL introduces unique security challenges. Be thorough in testing query limits, input validation, and authorization. The API's security depends on proper implementation of these controls.
