# Phase 3 Review Plan - GraphQL Implementation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 3 checkpoints. Phase 3 implements a complete GraphQL API with queries, mutations, and subscriptions, building upon the foundation established in Phases 1 & 2.

## Review Context

Phase 3 adds the GraphQL layer to the PCF-RS API, requiring careful review of:
- Schema design and type safety
- Security controls (depth/complexity limits)
- Performance optimizations (DataLoader, N+1 prevention)
- Real-time capabilities (WebSocket subscriptions)
- Integration with existing infrastructure

## Core Review Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
At every checkpoint, MUST verify TDD practices by checking:
1. **GraphQL tests exist before resolvers**
2. **Security tests precede security implementation**
3. **Subscription tests written before WebSocket code**
4. **DataLoader tests before batching logic**
5. **All edge cases covered** - invalid queries, authorization failures, connection drops

### Documentation Standards
GraphQL code MUST have comprehensive documentation including:
1. **Schema documentation** - All types, fields, and arguments
2. **Resolver logic explained** - Why decisions were made
3. **Security controls documented** - Limits and their rationale
4. **WebSocket lifecycle** - Connection, subscription, cleanup
5. **Performance considerations** - DataLoader usage, query optimization

### Code Quality Requirements
1. **NO .unwrap() or .expect() in production code paths** - test code and compile-time constants MAY use these with justification
2. **All futures properly handled** - No forgotten awaits in resolvers
3. **Resource cleanup guaranteed** - WebSocket connections, subscriptions
4. **Metrics properly scoped** - Avoid high cardinality in GraphQL metrics
5. **Security controls enforced** - Depth/complexity limits active

## Review Process Flow

1. **Receive checkpoint artifacts**:
   - Checkpoint number and description
   - All code files created/modified
   - Test output showing TDD approach
   - Any questions in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-questions.md`

2. **Execute review checklist** - MUST complete ALL items before proceeding

3. **Test the GraphQL implementation** using provided test commands

4. **Document findings** in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-feedback.md`

5. **Write progress notes** in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-review-vY.md`

6. **Answer any questions** found in `api/.claude/.reviews/checkpoint-X-questions.md`

7. **Provide clear decision**:
   - APPROVED: All requirements met
   - APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS: Minor issues that can be fixed in parallel
   - CHANGES REQUIRED: Critical issues blocking progress

## Review Scope Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Reviews are scoped to ONLY:
- The current checkpoint being reviewed
- Previously completed checkpoints in this phase
- Integration with Phase 1 & 2 components

**DO NOT** review or suggest changes for future checkpoints.

## How to Test GraphQL-Specific Scenarios

### Query Depth Testing
```bash
# Create nested query
cat << EOF | curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @-
{
  "query": "{ notes { edges { node { author { notes { edges { node { id } } } } } } } }"
}
EOF
# Count nesting levels - should fail if >15
```

### DataLoader Verification
```bash
# Enable query logging
RUST_LOG=sqlx=debug cargo run

# Run query with multiple same-author requests
# Should see batched SQL queries, not individual ones
```

### WebSocket Connection Test
```bash
# Test subscription
websocat -t ws://localhost:8080/graphql/ws << EOF
{"id":"1","type":"connection_init"}
{"id":"2","type":"subscribe","payload":{"query":"subscription { noteCreated { id title } }"}}
EOF

# In another terminal, create a note
# Should see event in first terminal
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### GraphQL-Specific Issues
1. **Nullable vs Non-Nullable**: Incorrect null handling in schema
2. **Resolver Panics**: Unhandled errors causing panics
3. **Infinite Recursion**: Circular type references
4. **Missing Context**: Context not properly propagated
5. **Event Leaks**: Subscriptions receiving wrong events

### Integration Issues
1. **Auth Middleware**: GraphQL bypassing auth checks
2. **Error Format**: GraphQL errors not matching spec
3. **Metrics Missing**: GraphQL operations not tracked
4. **Health Check**: GraphQL health not included
5. **Configuration**: GraphQL config not following patterns

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
MUST grant approval ONLY when ALL of the following are met:
- All checklist items pass
- No CRITICAL or HIGH issues remain
- Tests achieve required coverage
- Security controls verified working
- Performance meets requirements

### APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
MAY grant conditional approval when:
- All critical requirements met
- Only MEDIUM or LOW severity issues remain
- Clear remediation plan provided
- Timeline for fixes agreed upon

### CHANGES REQUIRED
MUST require changes when:
- Any CRITICAL issues found
- Multiple HIGH issues present
- Security vulnerabilities exist
- Core functionality broken
- Integration with Phase 1/2 fails

## Final Phase 3 Validation

Before approving Phase 3 completion:
1. Run complete GraphQL introspection (demo mode)
2. Execute all example queries/mutations/subscriptions
3. Verify metrics show expected values
4. Test error scenarios comprehensively
5. Validate security limits cannot be bypassed
6. Ensure smooth Phase 4 transition path

## Recovery Guidance for Reviewers

### When Tests Fail
1. Check if GraphQL server is running
2. Verify database is accessible
3. Ensure demo feature flag is set
4. Check for port conflicts

### When Security Tests Fail
1. Verify extensions are added to schema
2. Check depth/complexity calculation logic
3. Test with simpler queries first
4. Review security configuration

### When Performance is Poor
1. Check if DataLoader is properly configured
2. Verify database indexes exist
3. Look for missing async/await
4. Profile resolver execution times

Remember: Phase 3 establishes the API interface that clients will depend on. Be thorough in review, as schema changes after release are difficult.
