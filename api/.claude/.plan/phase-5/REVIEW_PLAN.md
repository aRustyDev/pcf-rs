# Phase 5 Review Plan - Guidelines for Reviewing Agents

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for agents conducting reviews at Phase 5 checkpoints. As a reviewing agent, you are responsible for ensuring the observability implementation meets all specifications, maintains security standards, and minimizes performance impact.

## Your Responsibilities as Reviewer

1. **Thoroughly examine all provided artifacts**
2. **Test metrics endpoint and verify Prometheus format**
3. **Verify cardinality controls are working**
4. **Check log sanitization for security**
5. **Validate distributed tracing implementation**
6. **Measure performance overhead**
7. **Test Grafana dashboards functionality**
8. **Verify TDD practices were followed**
9. **Provide explicit feedback on findings**
10. **Give clear approval or rejection**

## Core Review Principles

### Cardinality Control Verification
At every checkpoint, verify cardinality limits are enforced:
1. **Operation name limiting** - Max 50 unique operations
2. **Label bucketing** - Status codes grouped (2xx, 3xx, etc.)
3. **Hash-based distribution** - High cardinality fields bucketed
4. **Dynamic monitoring** - Alerts on cardinality growth
5. **"other" fallback** - Overflow handled gracefully

### Security Verification
Ensure no sensitive data is exposed:
1. **No PII in metrics** - User IDs, emails never as labels
2. **Log sanitization works** - All sensitive fields redacted
3. **Metrics endpoint secured** - IP allowlist or network restriction
4. **Trace sampling safe** - No sensitive data in spans
5. **Error messages generic** - No internal details leaked

### Performance Verification
Check observability overhead is acceptable:
1. **Metrics collection < 1% overhead** - Use benchmarks
2. **Logging non-blocking** - Async writers used
3. **Trace sampling configured** - Not 100% in production
4. **No memory leaks** - Stable under load
5. **Histogram buckets optimized** - Reasonable bucket sizes

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Verification
Continue verifying TDD practices:
1. **Tests exist before implementation** - Check git history
2. **Tests fail first, then pass** - Red-Green-Refactor
3. **Tests cover edge cases** - Cardinality limits, sanitization
4. **Performance tests included** - Overhead measurements

## Review Process

For each checkpoint review:

1. **Receive from implementing agent**:
   - Link to Phase 5 REVIEW_PLAN.md
   - Link to Phase 5 WORK_PLAN.md
   - Specific checkpoint number
   - All artifacts listed for that checkpoint
   - Evidence of TDD approach

2. **Perform the review** using checkpoint-specific checklist

3. **Test critical observability features**:
   - Metrics endpoint returns valid Prometheus format
   - Cardinality limits prevent explosion
   - Logs are properly sanitized
   - Traces propagate correctly
   - Performance overhead is acceptable

4. **Document your findings** in structured format

5. **Provide clear decision**: APPROVED or CHANGES REQUIRED

## Checkpoint-Specific Review Guidelines

### ðŸ›‘ CHECKPOINT 1: Metrics Implementation Review

**What You're Reviewing**: Prometheus metrics and cardinality control

**Key Specifications to Verify**:
- /metrics endpoint returns Prometheus format
- All required metrics implemented
- Cardinality limiter prevents explosion
- No sensitive data in labels
- Performance sampling works

**Required Tests**:
```bash
# Test metrics endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | promtool check metrics

# Verify cardinality limiting
# Make requests with 100 different operation names
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/graphql \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"query\":\"{ operation_$i { id } }\"}"
done

# Check metrics - should see max 50 operations + "other"
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep graphql_request_total | wc -l

# Test metric values
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep -E "graphql_request_total|graphql_request_duration_seconds"
```

**Cardinality Verification**:
```bash
# Calculate total cardinality
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep -E "^[^#]" | wc -l

# Check specific metric cardinality
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep graphql_request_total | sort | uniq | wc -l
# Should not exceed: 3 types Ã— 50 operations Ã— 2 statuses = 300

# Verify bucketing works
# Make requests with various status codes
for code in 200 201 400 404 500 503; do
  # Simulate response with status code
done
# Check metrics show bucketed values (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)
```

## How to Handle Issues

When you find issues during review:

1. **Categorize by severity**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Security exposure, data leaks
   - **HIGH**: Missing cardinality control, no sanitization
   - **MEDIUM**: Performance overhead, missing metrics
   - **LOW**: Dashboard improvements, documentation

2. **Test security thoroughly**:
   - Can PII leak into metrics? (CRITICAL)
   - Are logs properly sanitized? (CRITICAL)
   - Is cardinality unbounded? (HIGH)
   - Is performance impact too high? (MEDIUM)

3. **Provide specific fixes**:
   ```markdown
   Issue: User emails appearing in logs
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Fix: Add sanitization rule:
   ```rust
   SanitizationRule::regex(r"[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+", "<EMAIL>")
   ```

## Review Decision Framework

### APPROVED
Grant approval when:
- All Done Criteria met
- Security requirements satisfied
- Performance overhead < 5%
- Cardinality controlled
- Only LOW severity issues

### CHANGES REQUIRED
Require changes when:
- Sensitive data exposed
- Cardinality unbounded
- Major metrics missing
- Performance overhead > 5%
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH issues

## Testing Observability Overhead

Critical performance tests:

1. **Baseline Performance**
   ```bash
   # Without observability
   cargo build --release --no-default-features
   ./scripts/load-test.sh > baseline.txt
   ```

2. **With Full Observability**
   ```bash
   # With all features
   cargo build --release
   ./scripts/load-test.sh > with-observability.txt
   ```

3. **Compare Results**
   - Request latency increase
   - Throughput decrease
   - Memory usage increase
   - CPU usage increase

4. **Profile Hot Paths**
   ```bash
   # Use flamegraph to find overhead
   cargo flamegraph --release
   ```
